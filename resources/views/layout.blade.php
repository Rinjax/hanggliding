                <h2>Why Hang Gliders?</h2>
                <p>
                    Hang Gliders really fly ... right up to the clouds in thermals and away on flights of several hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graceful flight of a hang glider with the aerodynamic pilot position really is flying like the birds.
                    Simply leaning the way you want to go the weight-shift control gives a wonderful natural feeling as
                    you swoop and glide and is totally unique to hang gliding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hang Gliders have a fantastic glide performance and an impressive speed range. High performance hang
                    gliders can reach 80mph!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike paragliders they won't collapse in turbulent air but maintain shape by their internal airframe.
                    The twist and sweepback of the wing provides a natural stability allowing hang gliders to endure the
                    roughest of flight conditions!
